\begin{exercise}
	If $ (a,b) $ are positive integers satisfying the universal property of 
	(3.1.20) show that the pair $ (-a,-b) $ also satisfies the same universal 
	property. Explain why this observation does not imply that the pullback is 
	ill-defined.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
	\textbf{Mark how do I get the angle on this diagram}
	For reference (3.1.20) is the following commutative diagram.
$$	\xymatrix{\ZZ\ar@{-->}[r]^b\ar@{-->}[d]_a&\ZZ\ar[d]^n\\\ZZ\ar[r]_m&\ZZ
	}
$$
We know from undergraduate algebra the least common multiple of two integers is 
only unique up to multiplication by a unit. Therefore, $ (-a,-b) $ should 
satisfy the above diagram as well.
The pullback is unique \footnote{Like everything else in category theory 
probably} up to isomorphism. Since -1 is an automorphism on $ \ZZ $ that takes$ 
 (a,b)$ to $ (-a,-b), $  so in either case the diagrams are essentially the
 same thing as far as we are concerned. 

\end{proof}
