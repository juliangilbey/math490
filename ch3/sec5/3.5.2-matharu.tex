\begin{exercise}
	Prove that the colimit of any small functor $ \func{F}{\sC}{\Set} $ is
	isomorphic to the set $ \pi_0(\int F) $ of connected components of the 
	category of elements of $ F. $ What is the colimit cone?
\end{exercise}
	
\begin{proof}
Since $ F $ is a small functor by assumption, we can construct the colimit of
$ F $ in the usual way. Define $ \func{\io_c}{Fc}{\coprod_{c\in 
\ob\sC}Fc/\sim},$ where $\sim $ is the smallest equivalence relation 
such that for all $\func{f}{c}{c'} $ in $ \sC $ and $ x\IN Fc,$ we have 
$\io_c\sim\io_{c'}Ff(x).$  
Recall that $\int F$ is defined a $(c,x),$ where $c$ is in $ \sC \AND 
x$ is in $ Fc, $ and morphisms are $ \func{f}{c}{c'} \IN \sC$ so that 
$ Ff(x)=x'. $ If we look at the set of connected components of $ \int F, $
we get $ \pi_0(\int F). $
The isomorphism between the colimit of $ F\AND\pi_0(\int 
F)$ is simply an ismorphism between sets
$ [(c,x)]\mapsto [\io_c(x)]. $ The colimit cone is exactly $ 
F\To\pi_0(\smallint F).$

\end{proof}
