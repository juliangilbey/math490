		Consider the forgetful functor $ \func{U}{\Mod_R}{\msf{Ab}}, $ which
		forgets the scalar multiplication structure of $ \Mod_R $ and treats
		it like an Abelian group under addition. Is this functor full, faithful, 
		or essentially surjective?
	\end{exercise}
	This functor is not always essentially surjective. If we let $ R=\{0\}, $
	then the only object $ \Mod_0$ is the zero module. Thus $ F0 $ only goes to 
	the trivial group. So if $ U $ were to be fully faithful in this case, every 
	Abelian group must be isomorphic to the trivial group. This is clearly
	not the case since $ \ZZ/2\ZZ $ (or any finite field really) cannot be 
	isomorphic to the trivial group. However $ U $ is both full and faithful
	as $ \Mod_0(0,0)\AND \msf{Ab}(F0,F0)=\msf{Ab}(0,0) $ both only have one element
	in them. So the only map between $ \Mod_0(0,0)\to \msf{Ab}(0,0) $ takes the 
	identity map in $ \Mod_0 $ to the identity map in the trivial group, which 
	is clearly bijective.    
	
	If we let $ R=\ZZ,$ recall that every abelian group can be uniquely 
	expressed as a $\ZZ$-module. In this case since $ \Mod_\ZZ $ is exactly
	$ \msf{Ab},$ the forgetful functor $ U $ becomes the identity functor, so 
	$ U $ is clearly full, faithful, and essentially surjective.
