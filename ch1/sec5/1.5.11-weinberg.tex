%\begin{lemma}
	%Recall that a group as a category has a single object $x$, and that each element of the group is a morphism in the category.  All domains and codomains are that object $x$.  There is one identity morphism $1_x$, which is the identity element in the group.  Composition is the same as multiplication in this context.

\begin{exercise}
	Consider the functor $F: Ab \rightarrow Group$ (inclusion).  Determine whether it is full, faithful, and/or essentially surjective.  Does it define an equivalence of categories?
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
	This is a fully faithful functor. For any two groups $x$ and $y$, the functor maps the group homomorphisms $f: x \rightarrow y$ to themselves.  In other words $Ff = f$.  This immediately gives us that the functor is faithful, as if $Ff = Fg$, then $f = g$.  
%$Ab(x,y) \rightarrow Group(Fx,Fy)$ is simply $Ab(x,y) \rightarrow Group(x,y)$ where $x, y \in Ab$. 
For it to be full, we must confirm that for any groups $x,y \in Ab$ that for any $g: Fx \rightarrow Fy$ we can find $f: x \rightarrow y$ such that $Ff = g$.  But then we note that $g$ is of domain $x$ and codomain $y$ as $F$ is just inclusion, and that any homomorphism $g$ between two Abelian groups in the category of groups
also exists in the category of Abelian groups.  Thus, we have the desired surjectivity.


However, our functor is not essentially surjective on objects.  We know that for $c \in Ab$, $Fc = c \in Group$.  For it to be essentially surjective, for any $d \in Group$, we would need to be able to find an $Fc$ isomorphic to it.  But this just means we need to find an Abelian group isomorphic to $d$.  That is impossible for any group $d$ that is not Abelian, as Abelian groups are only isomorphic to Abelian groups. It thus does not define an equivalence of categories, however the Abelian groups are a subcategory. 
\end{proof}
