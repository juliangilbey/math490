\begin{exercise}
	Show that the construction of the set of conjugacy classes of elements of a
	group is functorial, defining a functor
	\(\mathrm{Conj}\colon\mathsf{Group\to Set}\). Conclude that any pair of
	groups whose sets of conjugacy classes of elements have differing
	cardinalities cannot be isomorphic.
\end{exercise}

\begin{proof}
	Let the functor \(F:\mathsf{Group\to Set}\) represent the construction of
	the set of conjugacy classes of elements of a group, defined as follows:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item For any group \(s\), \(Fs = s^*\).

		\item For any groups \(s\) and \(t\) and any group homomorphism
			\(f\colon s\to 	t\), define the morphism \(Ff\colon s^*\to t^*\)
			such that for each \([x]\in s^*\), \(Ff([x]) = [f(x)]\).\smallskip\\
			\textit{\footnotesize (The proof that every \(Ff\) is well-defined
			is non-trivial; see Subproof 1.3.x.0, below.)}
	\end{itemize}

	First we will prove that \(F\) is functorial by showing that it fulfills
	both functoriality axioms:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Let \(f\) and \(g\) be group homomorphisms such that \(gf\) is a
			valid composition, and let \([x]\in(\textrm{dom}(f))^*\) be
			arbitrary. \[FgFf([x])=Fg([f(x)])=[g(f(x))]=[gf(x)]=F(gf([x])).\]
			Since \([x]\), f, and g were arbitrary, \(FgFf = F(gf)\). So \(F\)
			fulfills the first functoriality axiom.

		\item For an arbitrary group \(s\) and element \(x\in s\),
			\[F1_s([x])=[1_s(x)]=[x]=1_{s^*}([x])=1_{Fs}([x]).\] Since s and x
			were arbitrary, \(F1_{s}=1_{Fs}\). So \(F\) fulfills the second
			functoriality axiom.
	\end{itemize}
	F fulfills both axioms, so we can conclude that it is indeed
	functorial.

	Let \(s\) and \(t\) be two isomorphic groups, and let \(f\colon s\to t\) be
	an isomorphism. Functors preserve isomorphisms, (as per the `first lemma in
	category theory') so \(Ff\colon s^*\to t^*\) must also be an isomorphism.
	This makes \(s^*\) and \(t^*\) isomorphic, which in turn means they must
	have the same cardinality. So we can conclude the contrapositive: that any
	pair of groups whose sets of conjugacy classes have \textit{different}
	cardinalities \textit{cannot} be isomorphic.

	\paragraph*{Subproof 1.3.x.0.} In order for each \(Ff\) to be well-defined,
	it must send each \([x]\in s^*\) to a single \([f(x)]\in t^*\). But there
	may be more than one element in \([x]\), and since the definition does not
	mention which \(x\) should be used as a 'representative,' it might seem that
	there could be cases in which there were multiple possible \([f(x)]\) (and
	therefore, multiple possible \(Ff([x])\)) for a single \([x]\). So in order
	for \(Ff\) to be well-defined, \([f(x)]\) must be the same for every
	possible choice of \(x\in [x]\). In other words, we need to show that
	\([f(a)] = [f(b)]\) for any \(a, b\) in the same conjugate class.

	So, let \(a, b\) be arbitrary members of the same conjugate class. Recall
	that this means that there is some \(n\in s\) such that \(b = nan^{-1}\).
	Furthermore, recall that group homomorphisms (like \(f\)) preserve inverses.
	With this in mind, \[f(b) = f(nan^{-1}) = f(n)f(a)f(n^{-1}) =
	f(n)f(a)f(n)^{-1}\]

	\(n\in s\), so \(f(n)\in t\). This means that there is some \(m\in t\) such
	that \(mf(a)m^{-1} = f(b)\). So \(f(a)\) and \(f(b)\) are conjugates, (and
	therefore \([f(a)] = [f(b)]\) by definition,) which makes \(Ff\)
	well-defined.
\end{proof}
